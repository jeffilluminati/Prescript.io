## What exactly is Prescript.io?
- A Destop application which serves as a Hospital Prescription medication delivery management system. 
- Platform that enables doctors to deliver prescription medication to patients, via the help of delivery drivers. 
- It has three clients, named **Doctor**, **Deliverer**, and **Patient**.
   - **Doctor** - Enters prescription for patients
   - **Deliverer** - Manages queue and delivers medication to patients
   - **Patients** - Acknowledges receipt of medication

## Why we believe this is a necessity

Prescript.io can be used for many purposes:
- In light of COVID-19, we believe that, due to hospitals being a major epicentre of the outbreak, regular patients that rely on prescription medication, need not travel to a high-risk zone to collect their medication, and can instead rely on Prescript.io to get their medication.
- It is a general purpose framework that can be used for any delivery services like:
   - Food delivery
   - Online Shopping delivery
   - Grocery delivery
   - Delivery of goods for charity services (e.g. for dorm workers)
